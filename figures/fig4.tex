\caption{Visualization of content resolution for location- versus content-based identifiers. 1) URLs point to a known location of a dataset, but do not guarantee either the presence or authenticity of the retrieved dataset; 2) the use of a DOI that resolves to a URL adds a layer of redirection; 3) A content-addressed dataset can be found by matching against recomputed hashes of available datasets in an archive; 4) well-known (online) hash indices can be used to facilitate discovery of dataset locations associated with a specific content hash.
